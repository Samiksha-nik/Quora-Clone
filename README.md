# Quora-Clone
Quora Clone using REST API I built a Quora-style web application that allows users to create, edit, view, and delete posts. It uses Express.js with RESTful API routes, EJS for templating, and method-override for handling PATCH and DELETE requests. The UI is styled with professional CSS for a clean and responsive user experience.
